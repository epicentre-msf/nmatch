# Example hospital datasets containing proper names in different formats

Example hospital datasets, one from an in-patient department
(`dat_ipd`), and the other from an ICU department (`dat_icu`). The
datasets contain some common patients but with variation in how the
names are written. Note these data are fake – the patient names are
simply random combinations of common French names.

## Format

Data frames each with two columns:

- name_ipd/name_icu:

  patient name

- date_ipd/date_icu:

  date of entry to given department
